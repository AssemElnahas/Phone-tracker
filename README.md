# Phone-tracker

This repository contains a Python script for tracking phone locations using public APIs or similar services. The script can retrieve the current geographical location of a mobile device, offering features for both users and developers interested in phone tracking functionalities.

## Features

- **Phone Location Tracking**: Track the geographical location of a phone using its number or other identifiers.
- **Map Integration**: Display the phoneâ€™s location on a map for a clear visual representation.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Retrieve real-time updates on the phone's movements (if API or GPS service allows).
- **APIs Support**: The project may integrate with popular geolocation APIs for accurate tracking data.
  
## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install geopy
pip install folium
```

Other optional libraries you might want to install:
- **Tkinter**: If there's a GUI interface
- **OpenCV**: For any potential image processing or real-time map updates
- **APIs**: Make sure to sign up for any geolocation APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phone-tracker.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python phone\ tracker.py
   ```

## Setup and Configuration

- **API Keys**: If the script uses a third-party geolocation service (e.g., Google Maps, OpenCage, etc.), you will need to configure the API key in the script before running it.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'
  ```

- **Phone Number Input**: Enter the phone number you wish to track in the script's prompt or GUI.

## Future Developments

- **Enhanced Real-Time Tracking**: Add functionality for more precise real-time updates.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Improve the interface, potentially by adding Tkinter-based visuals or dashboards.
- **Multiple Phone Tracking**: Support for tracking multiple phones simultaneously.
